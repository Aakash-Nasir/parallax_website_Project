 <h2> How to Plan Your Trip?</h2>

  <p>   Once you've decided where you want to go, it's time to start planning your trip. Here are a few tips:

        Set a budget. Travel can be expensive, so it's important to set a budget before you go. This will help you to track your spending and make sure that you don't overspend.
    
        Book your flights and accommodation in advance. This is especially important if you're traveling during peak season.
    
        Get travel insurance. This is essential to protect yourself against unexpected events, such as lost luggage or medical emergencies.
    
        Research your destination. This will help you to learn about the local culture and customs, as well as the things to see and do.
    
        Create a packing list. This will help you to pack efficiently and avoid overpacking.

        <h2> WHEN TO TRAVEL?</h2>
       
         <p>  Warm weather destinations: Think tropical beaches, deserts, and Mediterranean countries. These places are generally best to visit in the winter months (December to February) or the shoulder seasons (spring and fall), when the temperatures are pleasant and the crowds are smaller. 
         <br>
         Cool weather destinations: Mountain regions, cities with distinct seasons, and northern countries are perfect for summer travel (June to August) when the weather is warm and sunny. For winter sports enthusiasts, the colder months (December to February) offer the best snow conditions.
